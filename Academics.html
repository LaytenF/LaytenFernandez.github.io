    <h1>Welcome to my academics page!</h1>
    <p>On this page, I will be talking about some of the things I've done in highschoool!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>AOIT 2021-2025</h1>
    <img src="" alt="AOIT Second Years" height=200 width=300>
            <p>AOIT, or the Academy of Informational Technology is a branch of the Academy of Industrial and Engineering 
            <br>Technology. In AOIT, I learn a vast array of things. We learn how to code, network, and build. This is because 
            <br>our teacher, Mrs. Cindy Takara realized that not everyone is going to go into the same field. For me, this is 
            <br>great because I get to learn new things, and decide what I may want to do in the future, like software 
            <br>engineering. As for leadership, I am the AOIT student represenitive on our board. I am also an ambassador for AOIT.</p>

    <h1>Highschool Judo 2022-2023</h1>
    <img src="https://github.com/LaytenF/OpenClassroomProject/blob/main/Portfolio%20pics/Judo.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Judo Team" height=200 width=300>
            <p>Waipahu also has their own judo program, and I joined it during my sophmore year. I played in multiple
            <br> tournaments, being the second seat within Waipahu's weightclasses. I unfortunately was never able to win any
            <br> tournaments. However, due to my rapid learning skills, and my leadership skills, I was able to be promoted to the
            <br> next rank, blue belt. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>NTHS 2023-2025</h1>
    <img src="https://github.com/LaytenF/OpenClassroomProject/blob/main/Portfolio%20pics/NTHS.jpeg?raw=true" alt="NTHS Students (Second Year Pic)" height=200 width=300>
            <p>NTHS, or the National Technical Honor Society is a nationally recognized orginization that focuses and creating 
            <br>leaders. This is lead by Mrs. Cindy Takara. NTHS is something that challenges me to become better than what I
            <br> even know. I am currently going onto my second year within this, and I now am the co-secretary to this orginization. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Esports Club 2021-2024</h1>
    <img src="" alt="Practicing in E-Sports" height=200 width=300>
            <p>The Esports club it a club where people come together, and play games, like Super Smash Brothers. The club 
            <br>originally created by Kellen Inafuku, and was made upon the request of students. However, our club isn't about just 
            <br>playing games. Recently, we have started to make highschool wide tournaments, and within the club, people push
            <br> each other every day to become better. During my time here, I have served as the vice president, and president. I
            <br> believe that during my time, I have been able to bring the club to these heights. </p>
